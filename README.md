<h2 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Jorge Luiz, a <br>Back-End Developer from Brazil.</h2>

<p align="left">
  I have over 2 years of experience in software development, currently specializing in building scalable and high-performance software solutions. 
  Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve worked on several projects, facing and overcoming challenges of various complexities, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nexus-profissional/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank">Nexus Profissonal</a> and <a href="https://dev-quizz-edu.vercel.app/" target="_blank">DevQuizz</a>

  My main stack includes Java (17+), Typescript, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker, and RESTful APIs. <br><br>
  Iâ€™m also pursuing a degree in Computer Science and have strong English skills â€” reading, writing, and speaking. <br><br>
  Beyond programming, Iâ€™m passionate about learning and helping others. I frequently share my study notes and write technical articles 
  with the purpose of supporting people who face difficulties in their learning journey.
